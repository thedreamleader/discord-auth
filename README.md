# Auth Bot
Welcome to discord-auth bot. This has not been implemented to be user-friendly to other people but feel free to use the code  if you understand it. Personal use only.
## Token Input
Create a `.env` file in discord-auth/discordbot.
The format in the file should be like this:

    DISCORD_TOKEN=Nzg1NDk2NDg1NjU5MTQ4MzU5...
  Will implement other parts of config in the future...
